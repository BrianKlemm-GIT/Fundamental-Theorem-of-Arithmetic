# Fundamental-Theorem-of-Arithmetic
This python script uses the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic to calculate the unquie set of prime numbers for a non-prime integer. If the user inputed request is a prime the script will alert them their input is a prime.


Calculating the product of primes for 500,001 took 6.35 seconds on my machine. Currently 
calculation time is directly impacted by the largest prime in the set.
